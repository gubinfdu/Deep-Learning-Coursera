This repository includes assignments of the online course: Deep Learning Specialization, provided by deeplearning.ai, taught by Andew Ng. (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning

The assignment of week 2 is to build a logistic regression classifier to recognize cats.

The assignment of week 3 is to build a neural network with one hidden layer.

The assignment of week 4 is to build a deep neural network with multi hidden layers, then apply this model in cat recognition with higher precision.



Procedures:

1 initialize parameters (W, b)

2 forward propagation

3 compute cost

4 backward propagation

5 update parameters

Step 2 to 5 will be repeated many times.
